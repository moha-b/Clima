# Clima üå§Ô∏è
Clima is a user-friendly weather app designed to provide you with almost accurate and up-to-date weather information in the simplest way possible. With Clima, you can easily check the current temperature in your location for today and the next six days, allowing you to plan your activities accordingly. The app also offers detailed hourly forecasts, providing you with weather updates every three hours throughout the day.  Say goodbye to complicated interfaces and overwhelming data‚ÄîClima focuses on delivering essential weather information, making it the go-to choice for anyone seeking a straightforward and reliable weather app.

## Installation Instructions: üí£
Before you start, you'll need to obtain API keys from the following services:

- **Google Maps API Key:**
    - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project and enable the Google Maps API.
    - Generate an API key and restrict its usage as needed.
    - To integrate the map with your project, follow the [Configuration](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutterw)
- **~~OpenWeather API Key:~~** 
    - ~~Go to the [OpenWeather website](https://openweathermap.org/).~~
    - ~~Sign up for a free account and generate an API key.~~
- **Open-Meteo API**
  - Go to the [Open-Meteo website](https://open-meteo.com/).
  - You don't need to sign up because this api don't have `api key`
  - Check whatever end point you need from the [Documentation](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/)
- **News API Key:**
  - Go to the [NewsAPI website](https://newsapi.org/).
  - Sign up for a free account and generate an API key.
> Due to insufficient data, the `OpenWeather` API is unable to provide the required information. However, the `Open-Meteo` API offers a variety of options to choose from.

### Setting Up API Keys `[ Important ]`
Let's start with setting up the APIs in your project. We can begin with **Clima** and then move on to other approaches.

To begin with, we need to define the API keys using this command.
```shell
flutter run --dart-define=YOUR_API_KEY=API_KEY_VALUE --dart-define=YOUR_API_KEY=API_KEY_VALUE
```
then we can get these values in your Dart code like this in a [EnvHelper](lib/core/helper/env_helper.dart). 
And use this class as your Environment specific config all over the project.
```dart
abstract class EnvHelper {
  static const GOOGLE_MAPS_API = String.fromEnvironment('GOOGLE_MAPS_API');
  static const NEWS_API_KEY = String.fromEnvironment('NEWS_API_KEY');
}
```
**Android configuration**

To make the necessary changes, please navigate to your app module's Gradle file and add the provided code.
```groovy
def dartEnv = [
        GOOGLE_MAPS_API: '', // leave it like this 
        NEWS_API_KEY: ''    // it have to be empty
];
if (project.hasProperty('dart-defines')) {
  dartEnv = dartEnv + project.property('dart-defines')
          .split(',')
          .collectEntries { entry ->
            def pair = new String(entry.decodeBase64(), 'UTF-8').split('=')
            [(pair.first()): pair.last()]
          }
}
```
**iOS configuration**

I didn't make it üôÇ

**Other Approaches**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```
2. In the project directory, create a new file named `.env` to store your API keys:
```
# .env file
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
NEWS_API_KEY=your-news-api-key
```
3. Save the .env file in the root of your Flutter project directory.

**OR**

do what I did, create a dart class containes the keys and add it to `.gitignore` like this :
```dart
class Api {
  static const String key = "your-openweather-api-key";
  static const String googleKey = "your-google-maps-api-key";
}
```

### Running the Flutter Project
Now that you have set up your API keys, you can run the Flutter project on your local machine. Make sure you have Flutter installed. If not, you can follow the official Flutter installation guide.
1. Install project dependencies:
```dart
flutter pub get
```

2. Run the Flutter project:
```dart
flutter run
```
This will launch the Flutter app, allowing you to utilize Google Maps and OpenWeather services within your project.

> **Note**
> Make sure to add the .env file to your `.gitignore` to keep your API keys private and not expose them in your version control system. This ensures the security of your API keys.
