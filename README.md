## Installation Instructions: üí£
Before you start, you'll need to obtain API keys from the following services:

- **Google Maps API Key:**
    - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project and enable the Google Maps API.
    - Generate an API key and restrict its usage as needed.
    - To integrate the map with your project, follow the [Configuration](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutterw)

- **OpenWeather API Key:**
    - Go to the [OpenWeather website](https://openweathermap.org/).
    - Sign up for a free account and generate an API key.

### Setting Up API Keys
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```
2. In the project directory, create a new file named `.env` to store your API keys:
```
# .env file
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-openweather-api-key
```
3. Save the .env file in the root of your Flutter project directory.

**OR**

do what I did, create a dart class containes the keys and add it to `.gitignore` like this :
```dart
class Api {
  static const String key = "your-openweather-api-key";
  static const String googleKey = "your-google-maps-api-key";
}
```

### Running the Flutter Project
Now that you have set up your API keys, you can run the Flutter project on your local machine. Make sure you have Flutter installed. If not, you can follow the official Flutter installation guide.
1. Install project dependencies:
```dart
flutter pub get
```

2. Run the Flutter project:
```dart
flutter run
```
This will launch the Flutter app, allowing you to utilize Google Maps and OpenWeather services within your project.

> **Note**
> Make sure to add the .env file to your `.gitignore` to keep your API keys private and not expose them in your version control system. This ensures the security of your API keys.
